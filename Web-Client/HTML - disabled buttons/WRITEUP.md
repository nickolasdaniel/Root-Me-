# HTML - disabled buttons
# 5 Points

We have a form which is disabled and we have to bypass it. Here's the form:

Now, the solution to solve this challenge is pretty much obvious from the title. If we open the ```Inspect Element``` we can see there is a disabled property of the form:

By removing the disabled property we can input anything in the form and obviously we can get the flag as it isn't a very difficult challenge:

So, the flag is: **HTMLCantStopYou**
