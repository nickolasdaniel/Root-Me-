# Javascript - Authentication 2
## 10 Points

We have a ```login``` button which leads us to 2 alert boxes which requires an username and a password. If we inspect it we can see it has a ```logins.js``` script which if we access we can see this:

We have the ``` var TheLists = ["GOD:HIDDEN"];``` which is basically what we need because what happens after, is pointless as it doesn't change our list. So the username is ```GOD``` and the password for the form, and for the challenge as well is ```HIDDEN```.
