# Encoding - UU
## 5 Points
```B5F5R>2!S:6UP;&4@.RD*4$%34R`](%5,5%)!4TE-4$Q%"@``/```

This is really a weird encoding type, it was the first time I saw this type of encoding, so I just took the decodable characters from
```http://challenge01.root-me.org/cryptanalyse/ch1/ch1.txt``` and i've put them into ```https://www.dcode.fr/uu-encoding```
and it just gave me the decoded string :).
